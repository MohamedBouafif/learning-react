## What I Have Learned
- **Setting up a new React project** using Vim.
- **Using JSX:** Returns JavaScript objects describing what React should display on the page.
- **Composability:** By creating custom components.
- **Reusability:** By passing `props` to components.
- **Creating components from an array of data:**
  - In this project, the data was stored in a `data.js` file.
  - In my next project, I plan to fetch the data from an API.
- **Mapping through data:** Generating an array of components, which allows rendering them inside the App component dynamically using a single component design.
