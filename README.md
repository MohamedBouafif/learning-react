# learning-react
A repository documenting my progress in learning React. This contains mini-projects, experiments, and notes that demonstrate my growth and understanding of React concepts, from the basics to advanced topics like state management, hooks, and component architecture.
# Projects
-**Project 1: Travel List**
  - **Setting up a new React project** using Vim.
  - **Using JSX:** Returns JavaScript objects describing what React should display on the page.
  - **Composability:** By creating custom components.
  - **Reusability:** By passing `props` to components.
  - **Creating components from an array of data:**
    - In this project, the data was stored in a `data.js` file.
    - In my next project, I plan to fetch the data from an API.
  - **Mapping through data:** Generating an array of components, which allows rendering them inside the App component dynamically using a single component design.
